  These are introductory level posts targeted at people who are relatively
  new to software engineering, particularly in startups and product companies.
  They typically cover relatively basic things that experienced software
  engineers should already know. The subject matter is usually well
  documented already, so the posts tend to exist to cover specific cases I
  observe, or because I can't find posts that explain things the way I want to.
