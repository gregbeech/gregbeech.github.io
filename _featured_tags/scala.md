  Of all the languages I've worked in over the years, Scala is the one that I
  find fits my approach best. It's a heavily flawed language and not easy to
  get to grips with, but it has a powerful type system and lots of interesting
  features, a strong community and great open source libraries, and runs on
  the JVM which means it's easy to support.
