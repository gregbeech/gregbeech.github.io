  I've done plenty of internal talks over the years, and recently started
  doing them at conferences. Talking in front of hundreds of people and
  a video camera is very nerve wracking, but at least I've got over the hurdle
  of doing the first couple. If you'd like me to speak at your conference then
  get in touch.
