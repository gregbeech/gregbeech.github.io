Deliveroo has always had job titles, but what they mean and the criteria for being promoted often hasn't been clear. At the peak there were over 700 distinct titles in a company of 1500 employees. A new company-wide levelling system is being introduced over the next couple of months with more detailed descriptions of what it takes to reach a certain level. One of the criteria for Principal Engineer is “World class at X” for some value of X. This got me thinking: What am I actually world class at?

I’ve changed the type of job I do frequently over the last seventeen years. I started as a test engineer, then spent a few years working as a consultant on client sites. In the last decade I’ve only had three jobs on paper but they’ve all been in fast-growing startups so internally I’ve changed roles typically every nine to twelve months to meet the business' needs. And not just small changes---I've made jumps from writing video encoders to building JavaScript apps on televisions to managing multiple teams.

I've changed the language I work in day-to-day no fewer than eight times in the last seventeen years, with libraries, frameworks and paradigms changing even more frequently than that. I've deployed software to various flavours of Windows and Linux in a variety of physical datacentres and cloud providers, using a variety of data stores, queueing technologies, firewalls/proxies, etc.

All of which means my experience is generally broad rather than deep.

That’s not to to say there hasn’t been depth. A few years ago I knew C# and the CLR extremely well; I could explain the nuances of the generic type system, memory model, garbage collector, etc. But I haven’t written C# or used the CLR in over five years so that’s all pretty much gone. It's funny how fast you forget things when you're not using them. Well, maybe funny isn't the word. Heartbreaking, perhaps.

I'm not world class at any specific thing, then. I don't have a value of X.

Pretty much everybody I know suffers from severe imposter syndrome. It didn't take me long to realise I don't meet the criteria and start questioning what the hell I'm doing with the Principal Engineer job title. Maybe when this new levelling system gets applied they'll realise I don't deserve it and I'll get demoted, or asked to leave quietly through the side door. Maybe I need to work out how to get world class at something fast.

Then a week or so ago [Tommaso Pavese](https://twitter.com/wonderingtomato) was walking around in a t-shirt with the slogan "Worlds Okayest Engineer" on the front. He's worn it a few times before, and I've always found the dig at the whole 10x RockStar Ninja Guru bullshit quietly amusing. But in this frame of mind it got me wondering whether you can be world class at being okay.

Before you start wondering whether I've taken leave of my senses, think about what it takes to be a world class generalist engineer. You'll probably come up with the obvious point that you need to be good at writing software. But there's so much more to it than that. If you've come up with an idea that you want to get into production, whether it's a new feature in an existing product or a whole new product, actually writing the software is only a small part of the process.

Here are some of other important things:

- ***Understanding the Business*** --- Good engineers don't just work on what they're told to, but come up with ideas and shape both product and implementation. You rarely have time to do more than about 10% of what you want to do, so you need to understand business goals to understand whether the idea has value now or in the future, and whether it's more important to build it well as a foundation for the next few years, or hack it together to beat a competitor to market (usually it's somewhere in between).

- ***Communication*** --- Once you've had an idea that you think will be valuable then you need to tell people about it. This often involves verbal communication, whether it's one-to-one, in small groups, or a presentation to a large group or the engineering leadership. It'll definitely also need some kind of specification written, whether it's just a Jira ticket or a fully fledged design document. Good engineers are able to communicate clearly and concisely either verbally or in writing, and can match their communication style to the audience.

- ***Politics*** --- Most people don't like dealing with politics, but the sad fact of life is that if you want to get anything done it's essential. As soon as you have two people you have politics, and the mess only grows as the company does. Being able to get the right people bought in **TODO**

- ***Architecture*** ---

- ***Taking Responsibility***

- ***Being Right***

- ***Writing Software***

- ***Monitoring/Alerting***

- ***Performance Measurement/Tuning***

There's a whole bunch of things I haven't mentioned here either like interviewing, mentoring, ***TODO*** but these are all useful as well.

None of these things are skills that people are just born with. They only come from a lot of hard work, reading, practice, success, and failure. There's such a breadth to cover that it's difficult to be great at any one thing, and even if you get great at one it's difficult to maintain without letting the others slide.

But if you can be at least okay at all of them then you're in a great position to be the person who can take an idea from inception to production, or who can be dropped into a struggling project and take control and get it back on track. If you can bring all these things together you can be world class at shipping. Shipping is a really important feature.

Sure, there isn't nearly as much prestige in being okay at a bunch of things as there is being the worlds foremost expert on a specific subject. But you're still the type of engineer that every company needs more than any other.

The world's okayest engineer.
