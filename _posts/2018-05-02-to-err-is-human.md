In an ideal world everything would just work fine all the time. However, the real world is rarely like that which means we need to handle failures. Different programming languages have different approaches to modelling failure, but even with Scala there are numerous differerent ways of doing so. This talk takes a look at the various types of errors and exceptions you'll need to deal with and suggests ways to model them.

This was a fairly quick talk. It was supposed to be 15-20 minutes, but looking at the video it seems I cut it down to about 12. The initial version was nearly half an hour so perhaps I cut out too much content! It's loosely based on [this blog post](/2018/02/09/modelling-errors-in-scala/).

Around 110 people attended the talk but there was no voting so I don't really know what the overall impression was. A few people came up to me and said they enjoyed it though.
