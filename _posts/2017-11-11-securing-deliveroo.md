Deliveroo is just over four years old and has grown incredibly quickly; we deliver millions of meals every week in 12 countries. When a company is growing at this rate, how do you get leadership, engineers and customers to prioritise security? I'll talk about how we did that, setting up a security team, the threat landscape, improving physical security, improving authentication, setting up a bug bounty program, handling personally identifiable information, and responding to security incidents. We'll also touch on the GDPR and what it means for your company.
