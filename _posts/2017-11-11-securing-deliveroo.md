Deliveroo is just over four years old and has grown incredibly quickly; we deliver millions of meals every week in 12 countries. When a company is growing at this rate, how do you get leadership, engineers and customers to prioritise security? I'll talk about how we did that, setting up a security team, the threat landscape, improving physical security, improving authentication, setting up a bug bounty program, handling personally identifiable information, and responding to security incidents. We'll also touch on the GDPR and what it means for your company.

Around 100 people attended the talk and 75 voted, of which 86% rated it good, 14% neutral and 0% bad. Better results than last time, although it was in front of a much smaller audience so I was somewhat less nervous which probably helped.
