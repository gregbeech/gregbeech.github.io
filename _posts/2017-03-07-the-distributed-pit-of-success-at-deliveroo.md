In just two years Deliveroo has expanded from central London to hundreds of cities in twelve countries, and the engineering team has grown at a similar rate. To allow us to continue innovating rapidly we need to be able to scale the team horizontally. But building distributed systems is hard, and typically requires hordes of very senior engineers with many years of experience and past failures behind them. This talk covers how Deliveroo is using domain driven design principles and powerful building blocks to remove this limitation and allow engineers of any level to quickly and successfully deploy new systems into production.

439 people attended the talk and 356 voted, of which 73% rated it good, 25% neutral and 2% bad. For my first public talk in front of that many people I was pretty happy with the outcome.
