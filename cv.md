  CV of Greg Beech, Chief Engineer @ Zego.

---

I’m an experienced engineering leader and engineer, with a track record of incepting, rescuing, and delivering projects that have company-wide impact. I've spent the last fifteen years working in high growth startups, from series A through G.

The type of role I enjoy is hands-on technical leadership rather than people management. This could either be in a funded startup around series A/B or in a more mature company with complex problems to solve, though my preference is for the former.

This CV doesn't mention technologies much as I don’t think it’s that important when hiring generalists, but if you're interested I'm currently most familiar with Scala, Ruby, Python, Dynamo, Postgres, Redis, and AWS in general. I'm a proponent of domain-driven design and functional programming.

## Deliveroo, Mar 2015 -- Dec 2020

### Principal Engineer, Apr 2017 -- Dec 2020

I was the engineering lead for security and compliance for much of this period. This included a variety of things including launching and managing a bug bounty program, migrating to and managing the WAF to give DDoS and bot protection, and building tools to analyse data and change policies in near real-time.

Larger software projects included rebuilding the service managing identity for all domains to consolidate it and integrate with third party providers, and an auditing system to make all business actions trackable and searchable. 

For the last six months before I left I was leading the geosharding of Deliveroo, a project with many work streams requiring coordination and changes organisation-wide to everything from infrastructure to web and mobile apps and data warehousing.

### Staff Engineer, Mar 2015 -- Apr 2017

I joined Deliveroo early on when it was around forty people delivering food in London. For much of the first year, three of us (one PM, two engineers) focused on launching eleven new countries in Europe and APAC, handling all aspects of i18n and l10n as well as other concerns like tax and invoicing.

Subsequently I spent a few months building a new team and launching the corporate product, Deliveroo for Business. After becoming concerned that this wasn’t the most valuable thing for us to be working on, I pivoted the team to focus on fixing our live ops tooling, monitoring billions of events to detect and resolve issues in real-time. This work also provided the foundations for decomposing the monolith into services.

## blinkbox, Aug 2007 -- Mar 2015

### Head of Platform Development (Books), Jan 2013 -- Mar 2015

I was responsible for the architecture and delivery of the books platform. My main focus was on hiring a team of engineers and evolving the existing monolithic Java web application into a federation of vertically partitioned services. Achievements in this role were successfully transitioning the team to Scala (primarily to give us a hiring edge in a competitive market), moving to an event driven architecture, and reducing the six-weekly develop/deploy cycle to almost continuous deployment.

### Principal Development Engineer Lead (Movies), May 2011 -- Dec 2012

Built the Xbox 360 native application and took the approaches we developed to improve the foundations of the mobile and web apps.

### Senior Development Engineer Lead (Movies), Aug 2007 -- Apr 2011

Worked with a small team to design and build a scalable platform. Developed a distributed video encoder including low-level libraries to read and modify video files.

## Earlier Roles

### Netstore, Senior Consultant, Aug 2006 -- Aug 2007

A variety of projects including presales, PoCs, and performance tuning.

### Charteris, Senior Developer, Feb 2005 -- Aug 2006

Developer on a number of systems integration projects on client sites.

### Microsoft, SDET, Sep 2001 -- Jan 2005

Test automation and performance tuning, at HQ and on client sites.

## University of Nottingham, 1997 -- 2001

### Chemical Engineering MEng (Hons), First Class

Awarded a BP Book Prize for excellent first year results and the J.C. Mecklenburgh prize for most outstanding fourth year design project.
