<!--author-->

This site is a rarely-updated collection of things I've written or spoken about over the years. All views are my own and may not reflect those of my employers. They may not even reflect my own views any more, as 
they do tend to change over time.

I rarely change jobs and am usually not looking, but if your message is targeted and relevant I'll do my best to respond. I have no interest in unethical or scam industries such as payday loans, gambling, or crypto, so please don't contact me about those.
