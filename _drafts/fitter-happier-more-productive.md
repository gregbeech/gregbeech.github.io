In the [first post in this series]({% post_url 2019-11-07-deliberate-engineering %}) we looked at why the "feels fast" approach to engineering fails, and the deliberate approach is more likely to succeed. This time we'll see why many teams continue to use the "feels fast" approach, and why deliberate engineering is often mistaken for over-engineering.

The way I've seen many teams work where the PM dictates requirements, designers dictate UX, developers decide on technical requirements, and EMs just talk about career paths and reviews are low performing and unhappy. These are the teams that tend to use the "feels fast" approach.

Starting a new project gives them a brief natural high while it seems to be working for the first month or two, because code is getting shipped and they're are seeing the first glimpse of new features. When it starts to break down and the schedules start to slip, and it raises alerts every day, it needs two engineers assigned to it for the next six months to support it... people don't worry. They think that's just how software projects are.

They don't know what good looks like. The norm is software projects that slip and extend deadlines and aren't what people want and aren't performant or reliable. They've never worked in high functioning teams so when they see good they don't recognise it. They see people who must be going slow because they aren't panicking or slipping deadlines or having incidents.

They see teams doing deliberate engineering and justify it as over-engineering.

Deliberate engineering needs a major mental shift, and requires all disciplines to work together more closely and care about decisions that they may have previously seen as being somebody else's remit. For example, engineers need to care more about the product requirements, and product managers need to make decisions about non-functional requirements.

The rewards are worth it though. Teams are more cohesive, higher performing, much happier, and the speed and quality of output will surprise everybody. Trust me, I've worked in those teams, and they are the best times of my career.
