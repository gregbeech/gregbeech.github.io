Let's play a word association game. I'll say a word, and you say the first word that comes into your head. Ready? _"Agile"_. What was your word? If you said "Scrum" or "Kanban" or "Sprint" or anything along those lines then, like most people, you're a testament to the power of marketing. Unfortunately, these concepts are irrelevent when it comes to being agile. If anything, in the way they're typically applied, they're the antithesis of agility.

So now you know what agility is, it should be fairly obvious why Scrum and all those other popular "Agile" concepts are irrelevant.
