Product managers spend aeons creating and rearranging them. Delivery managers obsess over their dates and dependencies. People in “the business” plan financials, campaigns, and more around them. But engineers---the people tasked with actually delivering them---mostly just moan about them. The engineers are right. Roadmaps are little more than a detrimental fantasy.

We’ll talk about why, and what I suggest you do instead, but first I want to be clear this isn't just a hypothetical opinion piece. At the start of this year I proposed a complete ban on roadmaps at Zego and while lots of people were worried about the implications on the way they work, fatigue with the failed promises of roadmaps led everyone to agree to give it a try.

The topic of roadmaps never came up again. Nobody missed the time creating or maintaining them. Nobody missed the pain of trying to change them. Nobody missed planning around dates that never materialised anyway. Roadmaps just went away, and everybody was happier.

The antithesis of agility.

What I proposed instead was that you can have the things you’re working on in the next  four to six weeks and then ideas for what might come after, but ideas have no ordering, and no dates.

“But how can we plan if there are no dates?”. Well, you can’t. But you can’t plan even if there are dates because roadmap dates are pure fantasy. In nearly 25 years I think I’ve seen one, maybe two, projects of a reasonable size that actually ran to the originally hypothesised dates.

But more than that, you shouldn’t. If you do more work than is needed too far in advance it’s likely to go to waste. Work closer together.

“How can I get stuff onto the roadmap” goes away because if your idea has more value then it gets into the next 6 weeks. Otherwise it never gets there.

We pivoted in the middle of projects because there was more we could do in the next 6 weeks to add value.

We didn’t need OKRs any more because everyone was just arguing about value all the time.

Ban roadmaps. Forever.
