- is this core domain? supporting? throwaway?
- do we know if this is going to be useful?
- what are the mvp requirements? future requirements?
- how long is the project likely to live for
- what reliability is needed? performance? etc.
- how much will it cost to run? now? in three years?
- are there any regulatory or compliance issues?
- do you understand the software you're using (e.g. SCAN)
